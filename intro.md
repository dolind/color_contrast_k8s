# Kubernetes CPU Autoscaling Demo

This scenario shows how Kubernetes automatically scales pods based on CPU usage.

You'll deploy a lightweight C++ service that simulates CPU load and a TypeScript frontend with sliders for *Active Users* and *Work Time*.

**Goal:** Observe the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) increase and decrease replicas in real time.
